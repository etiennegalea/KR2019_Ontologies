Task 2 - Redundancies

Redundancy 1: VegetarianPizzaEquivalent2
* This is identical to VegetarianPizzaEquivalent1, which defines the already-existing logic in VegetarianTopping, making this statement redundant.

Redundancy 2: VegetarianPizza
* The only purpose of this class is to provide a negation statement to NonVegetarianPizza. 
* Removing this class and setting the negated statement to NonVegetarianPizza will render VegetarianPizza Redundant. 
* VegetarianPizza is also a more generalised version of VegetarianPizzaEquivalent2.

Redundancy 3: SpicyPizzaEquivalent
* This is equivalent to SpicyPizza, with the difference that SpicyPizzaEquivalent uses the logic already defined in SpicyTopping, rather than implementing it directly, rendering this class redundant.

Redundancy 4: Spiciness Equivalence (Hot or Medium or Mild)
* Spiciness is equivalent to Hot or Medium or Mild. This equivalence is redundant as Hot, Medium and Mild are already a subclass of Spiciness.
