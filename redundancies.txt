Task 2 - Redundancies

Redundancy 1: VegetarianPizzaEquivalent1
* This is identical to VegetarianPizzaEquivalent2, which makes use of the VegetarianTopping class, despite VegetarianTopping statement being identical to VegetarianPizzaEquivalent1.

Redundancy 2: Vegetarian Pizza Topping
* This is an extension of Redundancy 1. This class is only Used by VegetarianPizzaEquivalent1. Vegetarian Pizza Topping is identical to the constraints of VegetarianPizzaEquivalent2, making this class redundant.

Redundancy 3: VegetarianPizza
* The only purpose of this class is to provide a negation statement to NonVegetarianPizza. 
* Removing this class and setting the negated statement to NonVegetarianPizza will render VegetarianPizza Redundant. 
* VegetarianPizza is also a more generalised version of VegetarianPizzaEquivalent2.

Redundancy 4: SpicyPizza
* This is equivalent to SpicyPizzaEquivalent, with the difference that SpicyPizza makes use of the redundant SpicyTopping

Redundancy 5: SpicyTopping
* Identical statement to the definition in SpicyPizzaEquivalent, making it redundant as its only use is by SpicyPizza
