Task 2 - Redundancies found

Redundancy 1: VegetarianPizzaEquivalent2
* This is identical to “VegetarianPizzaEquivalent1”, which defines the already-existing logic in “VegetarianTopping”, making this statement redundant.

Redundancy 2: VegetarianPizza
* The only purpose of this class is to provide a negation statement to “NonVegetarianPizza”. 
* “VegetarianPizza” does not indicate what toppings make a vegetarian Pizza, its logic only states that a vegetarian pizza should not have seafood or meat. We do not have any indication if it includes vegetarian toppings.
* Removing this class and setting the negated statement to “NonVegetarianPizza” will render “VegetarianPizza” redundant.

Redundancy 3: SpicyPizzaEquivalent
* This is equivalent to “SpicyPizza”, with the difference that “SpicyPizzaEquivalent” uses the logic already defined in “SpicyTopping”, rather than implementing it directly, rendering this class redundant.

Redundancy 4: Spiciness Equivalence (Hot or Medium or Mild)
* “Spiciness” is equivalent to “Hot” or “Medium” or “Mild”. This statement is redundant as “Hot”, “Medium” and “Mild” are already in the subclass of “Spiciness”.

Redundancy 5: NamedPizza
The “NamedPizza” class is equivalent to the “Pizza” class, and a subclass of “Pizza” itself, therefore “NamedPizza” is redundant.



Task 3 - New Redundancies


Redundancy 1: DisgustingPizza
* “DisgustingPizza” class is redundant since it is partially inferring the logic of the “Margherita” class, where it can just use the definition of “Margherita”.

Redundancy 2: NonVegetarianPizza1
* “NonVegetarianPizza1” uses logic newly created in “NonVegetarianTopping”, which is set to be equal to any “SeafoodTopping” or “MeatTopping”. This makes “NonVegetarianPizza1” equivalent to “NonVegetarianPizza”, therefore redundant.

Redundancy 3: LateNightPizza
* “LateNightPizza” class is redundant since it is defined as being a "Pizza" and also a "NamedPizza" which are equivalent. Also, "LateNightPizza" is defined as having "some PizzaTopping" which all "Pizza" classes have already, therefore redundant.
