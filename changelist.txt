Task 1 - Removal of inconsistencies

Inconsistency 1: Cheesy Vegetable Topping
* Vegetable and cheese toppings were disjoint
* Cheese Topping was set to not be disjoint from Vegetable Topping, and vice-versa, to validate the Cheesy Vegetable Topping

Inconsistency 2: Ice Cream
* Had assigned "hasTopping some FruitTopping", which implied that any topping couldâ€™ve been applied.
* hasTopping only accepts all toppings in the Pizza class. IceCream is not part of the Pizza class
* Setting The IceCream subclass to "hasTopping only FruitTopping" implies that IceCream can only have a FruitTopping, and nothing else.
